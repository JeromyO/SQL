-- This project involves extracting meaningful customer and order statistics from a complex database using SQL.

-- How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as Total_Orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


-- How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as Total_iPhones
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone';

-- Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February?
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN FebSales fs
ON c.order_id = fs.orderID
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

-- Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, min(price) as Lowest_Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 10;

-- What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT SUM(Quantity * price) as Total_Revenue, SUM(Quantity) as Total_Quantity, product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

-- Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity * price), SUM(Quantity) as Tota_Quantity
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'

-- How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), AVG(fs.Quantity * price) as Average_Spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales fs
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
ON fs.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
