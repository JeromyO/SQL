-- First exercise from Practical SQL. All the litte notes and comments are my notes from the book. 
-- Created a table and inserted data into that table, also going to add all the other exercises related to the Teachers table we created. 

CREATE DATABASE analysis; --Created our Database we will be using for analysis. 

CREATE TABLE teachers (
	id bigserial, -- auto-increments everytime you add a row to the table
	first_name varchar(25), -- text column with maximum length 25 for this instance
	last_name varchar(50), 
	school varchar(50),
	hire_date date,
	salary numeric

-- We are not limited to sorting by just one column, however, it is most useful to limit the columns to answer specific questions by running several queries. 
-- We ordered by the schools with the newly hired teachers listed first.

--we can use DISTINCT with more than one column
SELECT DISTINCT school, salary
