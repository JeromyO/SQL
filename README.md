# Jeromy Olszynski's SQL Portfolio 

## Welcome to my SQL Portfolio. This repository contains code I have written. 

## The branches labeled PracSQL are from the book Practical SQL Second Edition by Anthony DeBarros, I'm going to add practices he had in the book. The book uses PostgreSQL and pgAdmin. 

## If you have any quesitons feel free to email me about: jeromyolszynski@yahoo.com
